# Verse Viewer

Paste in your ministry portion with verse references. Click the "go" button and it will find the verses for you.

You can then click on the <b>bold</b> verse to expand them out.

Verse Viewer will attempt to prefetch the verses, but if it fails to prefetch, it will attempt to load the verse again when you click on it.
